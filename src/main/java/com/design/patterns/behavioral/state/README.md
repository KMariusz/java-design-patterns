# State Pattern

The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## When to Use
- When an object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state
- When you have a lot of conditional statements that alter how the object behaves based on its current state

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/behavioral/state/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.behavioral.state.Demo
   ```
