# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## When to Use
- When your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don't want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products
- When you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/creational/abstract_factory/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.creational.abstract_factory.Demo
   ```
