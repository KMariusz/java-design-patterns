# Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## When to Use
- When you want to avoid a constructor with many parameters (telescoping constructor anti-pattern)
- When you want to create different representations of an object
- When you need to create an object with many optional components

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/creational/builder/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.creational.builder.Demo
   ```
