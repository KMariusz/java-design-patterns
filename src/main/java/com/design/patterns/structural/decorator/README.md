# Decorator Pattern

The Decorator pattern lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## When to Use
- When you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects
- When extension by subclassing is impractical (e.g., due to a large number of independent extensions)
- When you want to add and remove responsibilities at runtime

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/structural/decorator/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.structural.decorator.Demo
   ```
