# Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## When to Use
- When you have to implement a tree-like object structure
- When you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly
- When you find that you're creating a lot of component classes that only differ in the way they handle child components

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/structural/composite/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.structural.composite.Demo
   ```
