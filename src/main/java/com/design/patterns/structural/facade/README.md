# Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## When to Use
- When you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem
- When you want to structure a subsystem into layers
- When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex system

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```

   ```
3. Run the demo class:
