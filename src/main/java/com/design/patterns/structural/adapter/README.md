# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

## When to Use
- When you want to use an existing class, but its interface isn't compatible with the rest of your code
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes that don't have compatible interfaces
- When you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/structural/adapter/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.structural.adapter.Demo
   ```
