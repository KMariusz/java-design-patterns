# Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

## When to Use
- When you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality
- When you need to extend a class in several independent dimensions
- When you need to switch implementations at runtime

## How to Run the Demo
1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac com/design/patterns/structural/bridge/*.java
   ```
3. Run the demo class:
   ```
   java com.design.patterns.structural.bridge.Demo
   ```
